# Warning
Use this  guide at your own risk. This guide only works when the page says No Appointments Available. **If there is an appointment available, but no available times once you click the Select Visit Time button, you must wait for the system to update. This will happen at the end of the time span listed in the appointment**
</div>

# The Basic Idea
Install the [C19 Magic NY Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/c19-magic-ny/feeepbmhmihglmdnafpaeddiinadkijb?hl=en&authuser=0){:target="_blank"} in your Chrome browser. It will automatically refresh the page every 10 seconds and click the "Select Visit Time" button if one exists. Combine it with the [Auto Click Auto Fill](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/iapifmceeokikomajpccajhjpacjmibe){:target="_blank"} extension to automatically grab select the time.

Alternatively, use the [Free Auto Refresh addon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-auto-refresh/lfkfikiejjfhpfbpgfolfkkdjpepmkal){:target="_blank"} and configure it to refresh the page and alert you when text appears on the page.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re registering other people, use Chrome’s autofill to save time when you get to that step.

**Pro Tip:** Right-click and open links in a new window.

# The Step by Step Instructions
1. Install the extension
   1. Go to the [C19 Magic NY extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/c19-magic-ny/feeepbmhmihglmdnafpaeddiinadkijb?hl=en&authuser=0){:target="_blank"} page.
   2. Click Add to Chrome.
   3. Click on the puzzle piece icon and then pin the extension to your browser.

2. Go to the [https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/](https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/){:target="_blank"} page to confirm eligibility and prepare to select a location.
   1. We have noticed that [Tops Markets](https://www.topsmarkets.com/Covid19Vaccinations/){:target="_blank"} and [Orleans and Genesee County](https://orleanscountyny.com/covid-19-vaccination/){:target="_blank"} also use the NYS system. These steps should work there, too.
   2. Ignore any messages on the main page that say that there are no appointments available.
3. Right-click on the link to Schedule your vaccine appointment at the place you want to go, even if it says there are no available appointments. Open this link in a new tab.
4. Click on the extension icon.
5. Press the green **Start** button.
6. Wait for your computer to make a sound and alert you that there is an appointment available. When this happens, select a time, or configure [Auto Click Auto Fill](/autoclick) to select the time for you.

# Phantom Appointments
NOTE: Occasionally there is a phantom appointment that makes the extension alert you. In this case you can either wait until the appointment clears out (usually 6:31pm).

# Now What?
Now keep your browser window open and when your computer goes bing! you've got approximately 2 seconds to get to that window and choose a time. May the odds be ever in your favor!

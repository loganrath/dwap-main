# Warning
Use this  guide at your own risk. This guide only works when the page says No Appointments Available. **If there is an appointment available, but no available times once you click the Select Visit Time button, you must wait for the system to update. This will happen at the end of the time span listed in the appointment**
</div>

# The Basic Idea
Install the [Free Auto Refresh addon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-auto-refresh/lfkfikiejjfhpfbpgfolfkkdjpepmkal){:target="_blank"} into your Chrome browser and configure it to refresh the page every 5-10 seconds. When it alerts you, grab a spot.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re registering other people, use Chrome’s autofill to save time when you get to that step.

**Pro Tip:** Right-click and open links in a new window.

**Tech Savvy?** Install [this unpacked extension](https://github.com/loganrath/C19Magic){:target="_blank"} in place of Free Auto Refresh. It will refresh the page every 10 seconds, provide an audio and text notification as well as click the Select Visit Time button if an appointment is available.

<!--Combine it with the [Auto Click Auto Fill](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/iapifmceeokikomajpccajhjpacjmibe){:target="_blank"} extension to automatically grab the time.-->

# The Step by Step Instructions
1. Install the extension
  1. Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-auto-refresh/lfkfikiejjfhpfbpgfolfkkdjpepmkal
  2. Click Add to Chrome
2. Go to the https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/ and get to the providers list. We have noticed that [Tops Markets](https://www.topsmarkets.com/Covid19Vaccinations/){:target="_blank"} and [Orleans and Genesee County](https://orleanscountyny.com/covid-19-vaccination/){:target="_blank"}. These steps should work there, too.
  1. Right-click on the Schedule your vaccine appointment link for the place you want to go, even if it says there are no available appointments.
  2. Open this link in a new tab  (This will be the open tab referred to in step 4.)
3. Set up the plugin
  1. Click on the puzzle piece icon and then pin the addon to your browser

  2. Click More Settings in the bottom-right corner of the window.
  3. Under When to stop task, choose “Some text appears” and then type in one of the words in the name of your location. (e.g. for Rochester I use “Dome”)

  4. Click off the settings window.
4. Go back to the open tab for your location that says "No Appointments Available." If your location has one appointment available for the current day - see Phantom Appointments.

5. Click on the extension icon
6. Enter a number of seconds in the interval (start with 5)
7. Click the toggle icon to turn on the countdown.
8. Wait for your computer to make a sound and alert you that there is an appointment available. When this happens, click the button and proceed through. If you are not successful, start by right-clicking on Schedule your vaccine appointment and open it in a new tab.

# Javascript Bookmarklets
A javascript bookmarklet is a bookmark that sits in your address bar and uses javascript to manipulate the page. Here are a couple bookmarklets that can be useful.

# Phantom Appointments
NOTE: Occasionally there is a phantom appointment that makes the extension alert you. In this case you can either wait until the appointment clears out (usually 6:31pm).

# Now What?
Now keep your browser window open and when your computer goes bing! you've got approximately 2 seconds to get to that window and choose a time. May the odds be ever in your favor!

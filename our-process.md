# Warning
Use this  guide at your own risk. This guide only works when the page says No Appointments Available. **If there is an appointment available, but no available times once you click the Select Visit Time button, you must wait for the system to update. This will happen at the end of the time span listed in the appointment**


# The Basic Idea
Install the [Free Auto Refresh addon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-auto-refresh/lfkfikiejjfhpfbpgfolfkkdjpepmkal&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1614361008096000&usg=AOvVaw2UONjt4MFQvNQjAEVcWyvc){:target="_blank"} into your Chrome browser and configure it to refresh the page every 5-10 seconds. When it alerts you, grab a spot.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re registering other people, use Chrome’s autofill to save time when you get to that step.

**Pro Tip:** Right-click and open links in a new window.

**Tech Savvy?** Install [this unpacked extension](https://github.com/loganrath/C19Magic){:target="_blank"} in place of Free Auto Refresh. It will refresh the page every 10 seconds, provide an audio and text notification as well as click the Select Visit Time button if an appointment is available.

# The Step by Step Instructions

5. Click on the extension icon
6. Enter a number of seconds in the interval (start with 5)
7. Click the toggle icon to turn on the countdown.
8. Wait for your computer to make a sound and alert you that there is an appointment available. When this happens, click the button and proceed through. If you are not successful, start by right-clicking on Schedule your vaccine appointment and open it in a new tab.

# Phantom Appointments
NOTE: Occasionally there is a phantom appointment that makes the extension alert you. In this case you can either wait until the appointment clears out (usually 6:31pm).

#Now What?
Now keep your browser window open and when your computer goes bing! you've got approximately 2 seconds to get to that window and choose a time. May the odds be ever in your favor!

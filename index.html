      <p>We have had a great run and secured over 2,000 appontments for people who needed a shot but could not easily find a spot! Fortunately we've come to a point where vaccine appointments are widely available, and we no longer receiving requests for help. So, we have made the decision to suspend our service. This page will stay up to document our process, but our form is no longer accepting submissions.</p>

      <p>If we land in the unfortunate place where people need help booking vaccine appointments again, we'll be back.</p>

      <p>Take care and stay safe, y'all.</p>

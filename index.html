      <p>We are an independent, very small group that is working to help those that are eligible, elderly and do not have the access to technology to get scheduled for a vaccination appointment.  <strong>We are not affiliated with any group or connection to NYS, county, or medical. We are just good at refreshing and filling out the forms quickly to book appointments.  There are NO guarantees!</strong></p>

      <p>We schedule by filling out the standard form on the <a href="https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/" target="_blank">NYS “Am I Eligible?” Website</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="/video"><img src="/assets/images/youtube-how.png" class="img-fluid" alt="YouTube Video"></a></p>

      <p>If you do have the technology resources, please try to schedule on your own so that we can focus on those that do not have the resources or ability. You can also call  <strong><a href="tel:18336974829">1-833-NYS-4-VAX</a>.</strong></p>

      <p>If you need our help, click the button to <a href="/form" target="_blank">Fill Out the Form</a> and we will try to get you scheduled. After we schedule you, you will receive an email and text message from CDMS. If your appointment is not for a while we may try to move it closer. If that happens, you will need to cancel one of your appointments.</p>

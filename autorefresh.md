title: Using an Auto Refresher
---

An auto refresher will automatically refresh your browser page. Some have more features than others. Here are the ones we've used:

# Free Auto Refresh
1. Install [Free Auto Refresh addon](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/free-auto-refresh/lfkfikiejjfhpfbpgfolfkkdjpepmkal){:target="_blank"} and pin the extension to your browser

2. Click More Settings in the bottom-right corner of the window.
3. Under When to stop task, choose “Some text appears” and then type in one of the words in the name of your location. (e.g. for Rochester I use “Dome”)

4. Click off the settings window.
5. Navigate to the page where you want the extension to run.
5. Click on the extension icon.
6. Enter a number of seconds in the interval (start with 5).
7. Click the toggle icon to turn on the countdown.
8. Wait for your computer to make a sound and alert you that there is an appointment available. When this happens, click the button and proceed through. If you are not successful, start by right-clicking on Schedule your vaccine appointment and open it in a new tab.

# Easy Auto Refresh
Easy Auto Refresh works very similar to the process above, but requires a license to for notifications.

# Auto Refresh Plus
[Auto Refresh Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-refresh-plus-page-mo/hgeljhfekpckiiplhkigfehkdpldcggm){:target="_blank"} worked when we first started this process, but no longer does due to the way it refreshes a page.

<p>We understand that you might need help. We are a small group of people who have full time jobs and volunteer our spare time to help those who need it. We are prioritizing those who <strong>do not have access to technology</strong> as well as <strong>elderly individuals</strong>. If you have a computer with Google Chrome, you can follow <a href="/our-process" target="_blank">our process</a> and grab an appointment for yourself. It may be new, but it's not scary, we promise. It also takes time.

<p>If you need our help, we have a form you can fill out and we can get you booked. We do ask that you use this form as a last resort. Please only fill out the form once. We do ask about scheduling conflicts and will attempt to schedule around any you provide (no guarantees though!). Please answer the following questions in order to access our form.</p>
